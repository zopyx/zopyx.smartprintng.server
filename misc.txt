Logging in repoze.bfg

A "hidden feature" of PasteDeploy (the package which defines the .ini format 
for a BFG <package>.ini file) is that you can just inject something in the .ini 
format found at e.g. http://www.red-dove.com/python_logging.html#config into 
the BFG app .ini file (literally just paste it in to the BFG app .ini file) and 
PasteDeploy will configure the logging module.  Then you can use the logging 
API to log to the loggers you've defined in the BFG config file.
